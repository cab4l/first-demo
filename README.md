first-intro is my first attempt at a demoscene production. It uses C++ 11 with
[SFML](https://github.com/LaurentGomila/SFML) for graphics, and uses [DUMB](https://github.com/kode54/dumb) to provide tracker music playback using SFML::Audio.

#### Credits
Code: mrnoda

Music: LOONIE - Lazersmoke (See his work [here](https://www.scenemusic.net/demovibes/artist/687/))

#### Effects
* Starfield
* Rotating Cube
* Sine scroller
* Borders
* Logo

#### Dependencies
first-intro uses SFML, OpenGL and DUMB. The build is configured to search for the development header and shared library files. To run the demo, the shared library (.dll/.so) files must be accessible.

#### Thanks
Thanks to Simon for helping me with C++, SFML and DUMB for their great libraries and to all those old school demo hackers who inspired me to write a demo.
